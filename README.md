This modified version of connect-4 is played on a 7x7 grid as follows: Starting from the initial position illustrated below, players take turns moving one piece of their colour by a number of squares as explained below, either horizontally or vertically.  No jumping is allowed. White plays first. Pieces can only move to unoccupied squares. The winner is the first player to form a 2x2 square of four pieces. In addition, pieces create an "impedance" field in the immediate (8-squares) neighbourhood around them, affecting the number of squares an opponent piece can move. The following table describes the number of squares a piece can move given the number of opponent pieces in its neighbourhood:
